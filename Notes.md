======== Server Side & Client Side Rendering ===================

Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
Definition:
In Client-Side Rendering, the browser (client) downloads a mostly empty HTML file and then uses JavaScript to render the content dynamically.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Definition:
In Server-Side Rendering, the server prepares and sends a fully rendered HTML page for each request.

========================== Strict Mode ===============

Its redenders component twice and gives warning if we used any depricated API's

========================== Components ===============

👉 React applications are entirely made out of components

👉 Building blocks of user interfaces in React

👉 Piece of UI that has its own data, logic, and appearance (how it works and looks)

👉 We build complex UIs by building multiple components and combining them

👉 Components can be reused, nested inside each other, and pass data between them

================== Creating and Reusing Components ==================

In react, we create component using function

Rules:

- Component name should always start with uppercase.
- Component should return JSX or Null

============================== JSX ===============================

JSX:
👉 Declarative syntax to describe what components look like and how they work

👉 Components must return a block of JSX

👉 Extension of JavaScript that allows us to embed JavaScript, CSS, and React components into HTML

👉 Each JSX element is converted to a React.createElement function call

👉 We could use React without JSX

React is Declarative : In this case, Tell JSX what to display on the UI not how to display or update it.
Imperative: We have to manually select DOM elements and updated DOM properties.
